%%%%  ABSTRACT
\chapter*{\center Abstract}

The aim of the project is to create an application which enables ASDA colleagues to identify
and inform colleagues of which items within their fresh departments are going out of date and
need to be marked down or could potentially be provided to food shelters. The technology that
will be utilised in this project will make use of mobile technology, backend web services and 
Database stored procedures in order to analyse and inform colleagues which items are likely to go 
out of date on which date and then informs colleagues to go and reduce the products. This application
will be used throughout ASDA stores by colleagues on a daily basis and could produce a significant
cost saving and waste reduction.
\\
\\
The final products of this project will be a system of applications which will be ready for deployment
into an ASDA store in the future. The requirements and periodic demoing of the produced solution will
be provided by ASDA technology colleagues.

%%%%  INTRODUCTION

\chapter{Project Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

\section{Scope}

\subsection{ASDA}
This project is being completed on behalf of ASDA.
ASDA is one of the four largest supermarkets in the UK stocking a variety of goods including fresh,
frozen and ambient food goods, non perishable items such as clothes and home products and various
other lines of stock. The main focus of this project will be on the management of fresh stock which
has a recent expiry date e.g. fresh fruit and vegetables and chilled meats and dairy goods.

As well as being one of the main supermarkets in the UK, ASDA is also part of the US company Wal-Mart 
which is at the time of writing listed as the largest company in the world. This affords ASDA some 
benefits with regards to technology via the use of shared technologies across the globe.

Despite this project being completed on behalf of ASDA the applications and software that will be produced at the end of it will
 be suitable for use by any business which deals with products that have an expiration date or use by date.

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}

The aim of this project is to design an application and stock management system which is able
 to inform store managers and store colleagues on which items of stock are going out of date or
 close to going out of date on the shop floor. This stock will then either be marked 
 down on the shop floor in order to be sold on the day or will be identified as able to be donated to other charitable
causes within the local community as part of the ASDA commitment to engage and assist in the local community.
\\
\\
The key goals of the developed system are to include:

- An application which will direct colleagues to which items need to be marked down.

- The hours spent in store manually marking down products will be reduced.

- Stock which is wasted will be reduced and identified for redistribution.

\subsection{Potential Expansion}
- Timesheeting
\\
Through the use of data mining from the data collected by the application, we should ba able to accurately predict
how long it takes staff to organisae and mark down the expiring items within their respective departments. Once 
this data has been collected then theoretically it could be used in order to calculate how many staff are needed 
in order to mark down items on a particular day depending on the number of items that need to be reduced as well 
as the length of time that it is likely to take the staff in order to mark down or redistribute the expiring stock
on the shop floor. 
\\
- Stock Prediction and Inventory Management
\\
By analysing the number of items which are expiring in individual stores we should also be able to perform trend 
analysis on the data which should highlight items of stock which are repeatedly marked down. This trend analysis 
could then be used to inform store managers and the ASDA inventory management systems of any over ordering which is 
occuring and allow for more accurate stock levels to reduce potential waste in the future.
\\

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Project Methodology}
The methodology that I have chosen to implement this project in is a scrum agile methodology which involves short 
iterations of development spread over the 8 weeks I will be developing my solution in. 
This will include the breaking down of the application development into smaller development tasks which can be completed easily. 
\\
\\
Scrum involves the sizing, estimation and development of the development tasks prior to development. Once completed
the developed features will be demoed to the project supervisors and stakeholders in order to gain feedback which 
can potentially be added to the project backlog and acted on in following sprints.
\\
The project will include the management and development of multiple application features. Each of the features will 
be detailed and documented on a kanban board (See Figure~\ref{fig:kanbanBoard}) which will be managed via the Trello 
application.  As can be seen in Figure 1 the kanban board is broken down into "To Do", "Doing" and "Done" swim lanes 
which allows the user to easily identify the state of the feature that is being developed.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./assets/images/Kanban-board.png}
    \caption{Xpire Kanban Board}
    \label{fig:kanbanBoard}
\end{figure}

Scrum typically consists of 5 different types of meetings: the stand up, the planning, the Retro and the refinement 
session. All of these sessions are performed once throughout the sprint in order to plan, agree and highlight any 
issues that the development team might be having throughout the week.

%%%%  BACKGROUND

\section{Review of previous works}

at the moment sustainability and environmental responsibility are very prevelant in our day
to day lives. This ranges from the recycling which is carried out by all councils across
england to the protests and activism that takes place all across the UK by groups such 
as The Extinction Rebellion. There are regularly discussions in the media about the impact
that society and our daily habbits are having on the world that we live in and what we need
to do to attempt to repair and improve our environmental impact. 
\\
\\
It is largely accepted that we all have a part to play in assisting and improving the environment
of the planet and this is especially true for large corporations and businesses. 
ASDA as one of the Main supermarkets in the UK has stood up and accepted its responsibility
which is why they regularly publish information on how customers can live more sustainably \ref{} 
by reducing their own dependence on plastics or by wasting food. 
\\
\\
ASDA has also focused on various schemes to be a more environmentally conscious retailer. 
These can include working with FareShare ~\ref{asda:foodwaste} or reducing their plastics. 
The reason that this project is being completed on behalf of ASDA is because we hope that 
the Application produced as an out put of the project will mean that ASDA can continue to 
innovate and be more sustainable by reducing the food wastage within their stores by
contributing more to charity, reducing the amount that is ordered into stores and by 
having a better grip on items that are about to go out of date so that they can be 
promptly reduced for our customers.  
\\ 
\\  
As part of the further research into the previous work others have done that is similar to my project 
I have looked for potentially similar applications which offer similar functionality to users. 
Below is an outline of the applications and a comparison against the functionality that they
offer against what my app will capable of.


%%%%  DESIGN

\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}
This chapter covers the planned design of the Xpire system. At the moment all of the plans
for the application are theoretical and could potentially change however I believe that
this is a sensible approach which should be suitable for the proposed system.

\section{Architectural Diagram}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./assets/images/architecture_diagram.png}
    \caption{Xpire Architecture Diagram}
    \label{fig:architecture-diagram}
\end{figure}

As shown in the architecture diagram (Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture-diagram})
- The Application will be reachable via 3 methods:
\\
- An android application which is available on in store handsets called TC70, TC70X and TC72. These devices are available to all colleagues who work within ASDA stores and are frequently used for other applications within the store eco system.
\\
- An android and iOS application which will be downloadable and usable from users personal devices
A web browser which is accessible from a managers workbench or a colleague laptop. 

\subsection{Application Breakdown}
As shown in the architectural diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture-diagram} the application will consist of three separate applications and two databases.
 Below are the descriptions and breakdowns of the applications:

\subsubsection{Mobile Application}
The mobile versions of the application will be written using React-Native which is a modern mobile development
 framework created and maintained by Facebook. The reason for choosing React Native is because of the fact that it is a well known and well documented framework with a large and active user community. It is also the recommended mobile development framework for ASDA and Wal-Mart. 

\subsubsection{Web Application}
The web application will be written using React which is very similar to React-native and has also been widely adopted. There are plenty of libraries for React and it is the chosen development framework because I am already familiar with the React ecosystem. 

\subsubsection{Backend Web Services}
Written in Java spring boot which ensures that the services will be enterprise worthy. The services will be hosted within a docker image and will be able to be span up on either Azure application servers or Azure Kubernetes clusters. Object orientated services written using the repository design pattern. All services will be thoroughly unit tested. The webservices will be documented using Swagger so that users and future developers are easily able to pick up and alter the code base. 

\subsubsection{Azure SQL Databases}
SQL data which will be encrypted in transit and at rest manually. This database will contain the item data including sell by and use by dates as well as unique item Identifier and item Name. At the moment I am unsure as to if I will store images of the individual items. If I do then the SQL database will also store the references to the relevant item images.

\subsubsection{Azure Cosmos Database}
The use of Azure Cosmos DB for logging data due to the speed that items can be both written and retrieved from the data stores. Azure Cosmos DB is the Azure non relational database offering with encryption both in transit and at rest. Azure also guarantee an uptime of 99.99999\% 

\subsubsection{Authentication \& Authorisation}
SingleSignOn is the authentication method which I have chosen to adopt for all of my applications. This allows the applications to integrate well within the ASDA technology stack and ensures that colleagues will be able to authenticate with their normal credentials. This removes the need for colleagues to need to remember new credentials or to have to have other accounts created in order to use the Xpire application. 

\subsection{Interaction Chart}
The Interaction Chart (see Fig~\ref{fig:eventTrace}) below which highlights how a user interacts with the planned application and the flow of processes in order to complete the scanning and checking of product details and expiry dates with a mobile devices.
The event trace details how a colleague will complete an item information and expiration date check process.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./assets/images/eventTrace-itemscan.png}
    \caption{Mobile Event Trace}
    \label{fig:eventTrace}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Data}\label{chap:data}
\section{Data used in the system}
The data used in the system will be item based information which will include a unique identifier
for an item, the expiry date / use by date of the item, the product name, the producer of the item, 
the store quantity of an item and an image of the item. 
All of this data will be available from internal ASDA databases. 

Other data which the application will make use of are the request details of requests 
within the system. This data is collected for the purpose of troubleshooting and monitoring
and alerting of potential issues within the application. The data will include, Request Type,
Request Content, Timestamp, Response Content, Response Information and Request Origin.
   
   
\section{Ethical Use of Data}
The data that is gathered in my application is not human related data. The application only deals with the gathering of information on items and stores. No user identifiable data is used therefore I have agreed with my supervisor that there is no need to need to apply for the
