Provide some brief description of your project, what the goals were,

%%%%  INTRODUCTION

\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
The aim of this project is to design an application and stocking system which is able
 to inform store managers and store colleagues of stock that is going out of date / 
 close to going out of date on the shop floor. This stock will then either be marked 
 down on the shop floor in order to be sold on the day or will be donated to other charitable
causes within the local community as part of the ASDA commitment to engage and assist in the local community.
